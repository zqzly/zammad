### Performance Impact  <!-- Optional -->

<!--
Does your MR optimize (or degrade) performance?
If so, apply the label and explain here.

Consider that some of OTRS’s customers had
HUNDREDS of agents, overviews, and groups,
over 2,000 tickets a day,
and over 20,000,000 (!) tickets in all.
How do your performance changes scale on a system of this size?

(Remember, these are not edge cases we can ignore;
they are really big customers, and we want to keep their business!)
