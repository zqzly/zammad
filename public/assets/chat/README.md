# Zammad Chat build

This folder contains a `docker` image and the required files to build the Zammad Chat from coffeescript and eco files. This workaround is required for now because of the outdated NodeJS 8 dependency.

The build process can easily be started by executing the `build.sh` file. There is nothing more to it except of having `docker` installed and running.
