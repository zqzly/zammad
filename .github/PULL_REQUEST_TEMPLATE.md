<!--
Hi there - a lot of love for starting a Pull Request 😍. Please ensure the following things before creation - thank you!

- Create your Pull Request against the develop branch. We don't accept changes to stable branches.
- Add a reference to the issue you are trying to fix. Just add a # and the number.
- Don't run `bundle update`. It's a honorable thought of you but some dependency versions (e.g. pg) are broken 😢 Just use `bundle install` if you introduce new dependencies instead.
- Run `rubocop` and `coffeelint` on your changes to respect the code style guide.
- Add tests for your changes. Feel free to ask for support. We are happy to help you.

* The upper textblock will be removed automatically when you submit your Pull Request *
