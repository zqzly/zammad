<!--
Hi there - thanks for filing an issue. Please ensure the following things before creating an issue - thank you! ðŸ¤“

Since november 15th we handle all requests, except real bugs, at our community board.
Full explanation: https://community.zammad.org/t/major-change-regarding-github-issues-community-board/21

Please post:
- Feature requests
- Development questions
- Technical questions

on the board -> https://community.zammad.org !


If you think you hit a bug, please continue:
- Search existing issues and the CHANGELOG.md for your issue - there might be a solution already
- Make sure to use the latest version of Zammad if possible
- Add the `log/production.log` file from your system. Attention: Make sure no confidential data is in it!

- Ask questions about Zammad configuration and usage at our mailinglist. See: https://zammad.org/participate

Note: We always do our best. Unfortunately, sometimes there are too many requests and we can't handle everything at once. If you want to prioritize/escalate your issue, you can do so by means of a support contract (see https://zammad.com/pricing#selfhosted).
